# Design

## Colour Scheme

- Five colours have been used throughout the website - #F6F4F3, #D5BDA9, #BA9D8C, #4C3B32 and #312C2D
- The brown colours were taken from a colour pallette, from the website Coolors, and were chosen as the brown reflects the bear theme

![Coolers brown colour image](assets/readme-images/coolers-img-1.png)

- I wanted the white to be an off white, to make the website easier on the eye, so used the #F6F4F3 colour I used in my last project. This colour compliments the brown pallette chosen

![Coolers cream colour image](assets/readme-images/coolers-img-2.png)

## Typography

- I used Fontjoy, a font pairing website, to help me make font choices. I selected Laila and Playfair Display as I felt that these reflected the game.

![fonjoy screenshot](assets/readme-images/fontjoy.png)

- To give the audio button a picture of a speaker I took icons from the website https://fontawesome.com/icons

## Imagery

### Favicon

- • I used a picture of a bear for my favicon. I chose this image as it’s a simple but very classic bear face. This image was taken from pixabay.com

### Card Images

- These images were all found on the website pixabay.com. There are eight different images, for the sixteen game cards, as there is a pair of each
